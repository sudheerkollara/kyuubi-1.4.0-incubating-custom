Title: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Kyuubi (Incubating) released {release_version}

Content:
Hi all,

# (To user@spark.apache.org)
# Hello Spark Community,
##

The Apache Kyuubi (Incubating) community is pleased to announce that
Apache Kyuubi (Incubating) {release_version} has been released!

Apache Kyuubi (Incubating) is a distributed multi-tenant JDBC server for
large-scale data processing and analytics, built on top of Apache Spark
and designed to support more engines (i.e. Apache Flink).

Kyuubi provides a pure SQL gateway through Thrift JDBC/ODBC interface
for end-users to manipulate large-scale data with pre-programmed and
extensible Spark SQL engines.

We are aiming to make Kyuubi an "out-of-the-box" tool for data warehouses
and data lakes.

This "out-of-the-box" model minimizes the barriers and costs for end-users
to use Spark at the client side.

At the server-side, Kyuubi server and engine's multi-tenant architecture
provides the administrators a way to achieve computing resource isolation,
data security, high availability, high client concurrency, etc.
